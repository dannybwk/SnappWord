# SnappWord 截詞 — Complete Product Guide

> AI-powered LINE Bot that turns language-learning screenshots into structured vocabulary flashcards in ~7 seconds.

## What is SnappWord?

SnappWord (截詞) is a LINE Bot for language learners. Users send a screenshot from any learning app or reading material, and AI (Google Gemini) analyzes the image to extract vocabulary words. Each word becomes a structured flashcard with: word, pronunciation, translation, context sentence with translation, and an AI-generated example sentence. Cards are delivered as LINE Flex Messages and stored in a personal dashboard.

## How It Works

1. **Screenshot** — Take a screenshot in any app (Duolingo, Netflix subtitles, articles, textbooks, etc.)
2. **Send to LINE** — Send the screenshot to the SnappWord LINE Bot
3. **AI Analysis** — Google Gemini multimodal AI extracts vocabulary in ~7 seconds
4. **Receive Cards** — Get beautiful flashcards directly in LINE chat

## Supported Languages
